%                   USER FRIENDLY FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY
%                          (For Matlab with SPM12)

% UF²C is an open source software developed at the Neuroimaging Laboratory at Unicamp that 
% aims to simplify and organize functional connectivity studies in neuroimaging through a clean 
% and validated methodology, without sacrificing quality. UF²C has a full processing pipeline:
% The user only needs to select the raw functional and structural NIfTI files from the subjects.
% The graphical user interface makes the processing and analysis options accessible for 
% neuroscientists, with reasonable choices of default settings. UF²C allows the user to study 
% functional connectivity both through a quantitative view that provides detailed values of 
% average connectivity and through a spatial view that provides statistical maps that can be 
% directly used for further analyses. All results are carefully organized in distinct folder
% for each subject, and a common folder is generated with a log file reporting the quantitative
% results of all the analyzed subjects.
%
% Several UF²C modalities and tools runs combined with Statistical Parametric Mapping functions.
% 
% UF²C is open source software, distributed under a BSD-style License.
%
% UF²C Requirement:
% Windows, Linux or Mac OS X operating system
% SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 8 or 12)
% MATLAB (version R2010a or later, required by SPM)
% MATLAB Statistics toolbox
% MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox.
% MATLAB Image Processing toolbox.
